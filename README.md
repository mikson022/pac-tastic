# Pac-Tastic!

Pac-Tastic is a Java Swing application that brings back the classic arcade game Pacman. 
It challenges players to navigate through a maze, eat pellets, avoid enemies, and collect various upgrades. 
This project demonstrates my skills in GUI programming, event handling, serialization, MVC design pattern and more.
